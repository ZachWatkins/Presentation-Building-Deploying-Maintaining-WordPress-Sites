# Streamline Building, Deploying, and Maintaining Your (Higher-Ed) Websites with WordPress!

I co-presented this conference talk at the Texas A&M Tech Summit in 2019 in Galveston, Texas.

Co-presenters are Hassan Abbbasi and Steven Word.

My portion of the presentation details my process for WordPress plugin and theme development at Texas A&M AgriLife Communications.
